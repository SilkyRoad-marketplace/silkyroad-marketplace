      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>Silky Road Marketplace (“Silky Road”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a digital marketplace that allows creators (“sellers”) to sell digital products such as eBooks, templates, design assets, music, films, software, and other downloadable content to customers (“buyers”).</p>

      <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
      <p>You must be at least <strong>18 years old</strong> to create a seller account on Silky Road. Payment providers such as <strong>Stripe</strong> and <strong>PayPal</strong> do not allow payouts to individuals under the age of 18, and all sellers must be able to legally manage payments and accept binding agreements.</p>
      <p>You are responsible for keeping your login details secure and for all activity that occurs under your account.</p>

      <h2>3. Digital products only</h2>
      <p>Silky Road supports <strong>digital products only</strong>. Physical goods, dangerous items, or illegal content are strictly prohibited.</p>

      <h2>4. Seller eligibility & responsibilities</h2>
      <p>Sellers must only upload content they own or have the rights to sell. You are responsible for accurately describing your products, including pricing, usage rights, formats, and any required disclaimers.</p>
      <p>All product listings, transactions, and payouts on Silky Road are conducted in <strong>USD</strong>. For fraud and dispute protection, Silky Road holds each payout for <strong>7 days</strong> before releasing the funds to the seller. This buffer period allows time to resolve disputes, refunds, or chargebacks.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only list content that you own or have full rights to sell.</li>
        <li>Ensure all product descriptions are accurate and honest.</li>
        <li>Comply with copyright, intellectual property, and consumer protection laws.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Fees and payouts</h2>
      <p>Silky Road charges a platform fee depending on your selected plan (Free, Pro, Ultimate). Third-party payment processing fees may also apply through providers such as Stripe or PayPal.</p>
      <p>Payouts follow the 7-day holding period and are processed through the seller’s connected payment provider account. Payout timing and minimum withdrawal amounts may vary depending on the provider’s rules.</p>

      <h2>6. Refunds</h2>
      <p>Digital products are delivered instantly after purchase. Refunds are generally at the seller’s discretion unless required by law. Silky Road reserves the right to issue refunds in cases involving fraud, unauthorized transactions, technical issues, or violations of marketplace policies.</p>

      <h2>7. Prohibited content</h2>
      <p>You may not sell or upload:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Illegal, harmful, or abusive content.</li>
        <li>Malware, viruses, or harmful software.</li>
        <li>Adult content that violates payment provider policies.</li>
        <li>Content that infringes copyrights, trademarks, or intellectual property rights.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Marketplace changes</h2>
      <p>We may modify, suspend, or discontinue parts of the marketplace at any time. Active sellers will be notified of significant changes that affect payouts or access to products.</p>

      <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>Silky Road is provided “as is”. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for loss of profits, data, reputation, or indirect damages resulting from the use of our platform, payment providers, or third-party tools.</p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms, engage in fraudulent activity, or abuse the platform. You may close your account at any time, though certain data may be retained for compliance and accounting requirements.</p>

      <h2>11. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have questions about these Terms, please contact us through the Help → Support page.</p>
