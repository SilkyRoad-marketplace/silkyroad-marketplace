      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>Silky Road Marketplace (&quot;Silky Road&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, or &quot;our&quot;) is a digital marketplace that allows creators (&quot;sellers&quot;) to sell digital products such as eBooks, templates, design assets, music, films, software and other downloadable content to customers (&quot;buyers&quot;).</p>

      <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 18 years old to create a seller account. You are responsible for keeping your login details secure and for all activity that occurs under your account.</p>

      <h2>3. Digital products only</h2>
      <p>Silky Road only supports digital products and online content. Physical goods, dangerous items, or illegal content are strictly prohibited.</p>

      <h2>4. Seller responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>You must comply with all applicable laws, including copyright and consumer protection rules in your country.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Fees and payouts</h2>
      <p>Silky Road charges a platform fee on each sale, depending on your chosen plan (Free, Pro, Ultimate). Payment processing fees may also apply via third-party providers such as Stripe or PayPal.</p>
      <p>Payouts to sellers are handled through supported payment providers. Payout times, minimum payout amounts and currency settings are subject to the provider&apos;s rules and our payout schedule.</p>

      <h2>6. Refunds</h2>
      <p>Because products on Silky Road are digital and instantly accessible, refunds are generally at the seller&apos;s discretion unless required by law. We reserve the right to issue refunds directly in cases of fraud, technical issues or policy violations.</p>

      <h2>7. Prohibited content</h2>

        <li>Adult content that violates payment provider policies.</li>
        <li>Content that infringes on copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Marketplace changes</h2>
      <p>We may modify, suspend or discontinue parts of the marketplace at any time. We will make reasonable efforts to notify active sellers of major changes that affect payouts or access to products.</p>

      <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>Silky Road is provided on an &quot;as is&quot; basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any lost profits, data loss or indirect damages arising from the use of the marketplace, payment providers or third-party tools.</p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms, abuse the platform, or engage in fraud. You may close your account at any time; however, information required for accounting or compliance may be retained.</p>

      <h2>11. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us through the Help &gt; Support page.</p>
